## Hook & Introduction

Diabetes is silently reaching epidemic proportions worldwide, outpacing many health projections. In the last few decades, the number of people with diabetes has exploded, making it one of the fastest growing global health challenges.



## Insight #1: Diabetes Cases Have More Than Doubled in Three Decades

Explanation: The global prevalence of diabetes has skyrocketed over the past 30 years, making it one of the defining health trends of our time. In 1990, around 200 million adults worldwide had diabetes – by 2022, that number swelled to over 830 million.


| Year | Global Adult Diabetes Prevalence | People with Diabetes (Worldwide) | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1990 | ~7% of adults | ~200 million | WHO 2024 |
| 2022 | ~14% of adults | ~830 million | WHO 2024 |

### 📊 Figure 1

### Takeaway for Health Professionals: For health professionals, this means diabetes is now twice as common as it was a generation ago – you are far more likely to encounter diabetic patients in any clinical setting. Health systems must recognize this surge and strengthen chronic disease programs, since the demand for diabetes care and prevention services has effectively doubled (or more) over 30 years.

## Insight #2: Today, 1 in 9 Adults Worldwide Has Diabetes (Nearly 590 Million People)

Explanation: Diabetes has quietly become one of the most common health conditions globally. According to the latest IDF Diabetes Atlas data, approximately 589 million adults (aged 20–79) are living with diabetes in 2024.



| Location | Adults (20–79) with Diabetes (2024) | Prevalence (% of adults) | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Global | 589 million | 11.1% (≈1 in 9) | IDF 2025 Atlas |
| Europe | 66 million | 9.8% | IDF 2025 Atlas |
| Middle East & North Africa (MENA) | 85 million | 17.6% (highest region) | IDF 2025 Atlas |
| South-East Asia | 107 million | ~11% | IDF 2025 Atlas |
| Western Pacific (incl. China) | 215 million | ~11% | IDF 2025 Atlas |
| Africa | 25 million | 5.0% (lowest region) | IDF 2025 Atlas |

### 📊 Figure 2

![Figure 2](figures/fig2_region_burden.png)

> To regenerate this figure, run `python scripts/make_all_figures.py`.

### Takeaway for Health Professionals: For health professionals, this prevalence means diabetes is part of “routine” now – roughly one in ten of your adult patients is likely to have diabetes. Every clinic, hospital, and community health program must be prepared to screen for and manage diabetes as a core element of care, because the condition is affecting broad swathes of the population.

## Insight #3: The Epidemic Is Still Accelerating – 1 in 8 Adults May Have Diabetes by 2050

Explanation: Not only is diabetes common now, but future projections show the burden will continue to grow significantly in the coming decades. The International Diabetes Federation projects that by 2050 the global diabetes population will reach 853 million (20–79 years).



| Year | Projected Adults with Diabetes (Global) | Prevalence (20–79y) | Notes | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2024 | 589 million (actual estimate) | 11.1% of adults | Baseline (IDF 11th Atlas) | IDF 2025 Atlas |
| 2050 | 853 million (projected) | ~12.5% of adults (~1 in 8) | +46% from 2024 (trend scenario) | IDF 2025 Atlas |
| Of which: LMICs | ~692 million (81% of total) | — | Vast majority of 2050 cases | IDF / WB analysis |
| High-Income countries | ~161 million (19% of total) | — | Smaller share of 2050 cases | IDF / WB analysis |

### 📊 Figure 3

> To regenerate this figure, run `python scripts/make_all_figures.py`.

### Takeaway for Health Professionals: For health professionals, this forecast means the peak of the diabetes burden is still ahead of us – unless strong preventive actions are taken. Clinics and health programs must prepare for even more diabetes patients in the future. Proactive measures now (community screening, lifestyle intervention programs, etc.) are vital to bending the curve of this projection and preventing our practices from becoming overwhelmed by diabetes cases in the coming decades.

## Insight #4: Nearly Half of Adults with Diabetes Are Undiagnosed – A Silent Crisis

Explanation: A striking aspect of the diabetes epidemic is how much of it lurks undiagnosed. Globally, over 4 in 10 adults with diabetes (about 44%) are unaware of their condition.



| Indicator (2024) | Global Estimate | Regional Examples | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Adults with undiagnosed diabetes | ~252 million (worldwide) | Africa: ~73% of diabetes cases undiagnosed<br>MENA: ~33% undiagnosed<br>Global average: ~44% undiagnosed | IDF 2025 Atlas |
| Proportion of diabetes cases undiagnosed | 43% globally | Africa: the highest (about 3 in 4)<br>Europe: the lowest (estimated ~1 in 4) | IDF 2025 Atlas; WHO 2022 estimates |

### 📊 Figure 4

![Figure 4](figures/fig4_undiagnosed.png)

> To regenerate this figure, run `python scripts/make_all_figures.py`.

### Takeaway for Health Professionals: For health professionals, this means a silent reservoir of diabetes is likely in your community – nearly half of those with diabetes haven’t been diagnosed yet. Proactive screening and case-finding (especially in primary care and community settings) are crucial. Early diagnosis allows timely management to prevent complications, so clinicians and public health workers should push for routine blood glucose checks in at-risk populations and make sure “hidden” cases are brought to light.

## Insight #5: Over 50% of People with Diabetes Are Not Receiving Treatment

Explanation: Beyond diagnosis, there is a concerning treatment gap in diabetes care globally. According to WHO, more than half of people living with diabetes are not receiving proper treatment for their condition.



| Diabetes Treatment Coverage | Statistic (Year) | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Global population on diabetes medication | Only ~50% of people with diagnosed diabetes (≥18y) are on treatment (approx.) | WHO Global Report 2022 |
| Proportion of diabetics not on treatment | >50% (globally, 2022) – more than half are untreated | WHO Key Facts 2024 |
| Treatment coverage in LMICs vs HICs | Much lower in LMICs (lowest in low-income countries) – e.g. insulin often inaccessible; higher in HICs, but gaps remain | WHO 2024 (Treatment coverage lowest in LMICs) |

### 📊 Figure 5

![Figure 5](figures/fig5_treatment_coverage.png)

> To regenerate this figure, run `python scripts/make_all_figures.py`.

### Takeaway for Health Professionals: For health professionals, this underscores the need not just to diagnose diabetes, but to ensure patients get on effective treatment and stay on it. Improving access to essential diabetes medications and education about adherence should be a priority. Clinicians, especially in primary care, must work to close this gap – by simplifying treatment protocols, addressing cost barriers, and following up with patients – so that a diagnosis of diabetes is promptly followed by proper management to control blood sugar.

## Insight #6: Four in Five People with Diabetes Live in Low- and Middle-Income Countries

Explanation: Diabetes is often thought of as a disease of affluent lifestyles, but today it is disproportionately a burden on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). An estimated 81% of adults with diabetes live in LMICs.



| World Bank Income Group | Diabetes Prevalence (2021) | Adults with Diabetes | Notes | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Low-income countries | 5.5% | 20.9 million | Lowest prevalence, younger populations | IDF 2021 data |
| Lower-middle income | 9.1% | 211.2 million | Fastest growth in cases expected by 2045 | IDF / Lancet 2022 |
| Upper-middle income | 11.1% | 279.2 million | Includes China, India, driving global numbers | IDF / Lancet 2022 |
| High-income countries | 11.1% | 73.7 million | High prevalence but smaller share of total | IDF / Lancet 2022 |
| Global Total | ~10.5% (2021) | 537 million (2021) | 81% of cases in all LMICs combined | IDF 10th Atlas |

### 📊 Figure 6

![Figure 6](figures/fig6_income_groups.png)

> To regenerate this figure, run `python scripts/make_all_figures.py`.

### Takeaway for Health Professionals: For health professionals, this means that tackling diabetes is a critical issue for global health equity. If you work in or with LMICs, be aware that diabetes services need rapid scaling up – from community education to primary care management – despite limited resources. Even in high-income settings, clinicians should understand the cultural and socioeconomic factors when managing patients from LMIC backgrounds. Overall, advocating for stronger health systems and access to care in low-resource settings is essential, because that’s where the diabetes battle will largely be won or lost.

## Insight #7: The Middle East & North Africa Leads in Diabetes Prevalence (Regional Hotspots)

Explanation: Diabetes is not evenly distributed – some regions and countries face a much higher prevalence than others. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region stands out as a major hotspot.




| Region (IDF Definition) | Diabetes Prevalence (% of adults) | Adults with Diabetes | Projected Increase (to 2050) | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Middle East & North Africa | 17.6% (highest) | 85 million | +92% (to 163 million) | IDF 2025 |
| North America & Caribbean | ~13% (U.S.~11%, regional avg higher) | 56 million | Modest rise (aging populations) | IDF 2025 |
| Europe | ~9.8% | 66 million | +10% by 2050 (to ~72 million) | IDF 2025 |
| South & Central America | ~9–10% (e.g. Mexico ~16%) | 35 million | +50% (approx) by 2050 | IDF 2025 |
| South-East Asia | ~11% (India ~11%, Bangladesh ~10%) | 107 million | Significant growth (aging + urbanization) | IDF 2025 |
| Western Pacific | ~11% (China ~10%, Pacific islands higher) | 215 million | Continued rise (varies by country) | IDF 2025 |
| Africa | ~5.0% (lowest) | 25 million | +142% (to 60 million) (highest % increase) | IDF 2025 |

### 📊 Figure 7

![Figure 7](figures/fig7_regions_prevalence.png)

> To regenerate this figure, run `python scripts/make_all_figures.py`.

### Takeaway for Health Professionals: For health professionals, it’s important to recognize if you work in or with a “hotspot” region – places like the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of Asia have extremely high diabetes rates, requiring extra vigilance in screening and prevention. Tailor your interventions to local context: for instance, in MENA countries, focus on culturally appropriate diet modifications and managing Ramadan fasting in diabetics; in the Pacific, community-based lifestyle programs might help. Even outside those regions, understanding these patterns can guide you in risk assessment – e.g. patients from South Asian or Middle Eastern backgrounds might have higher risk at lower BMIs, so you might screen them earlier for diabetes.

## Insight #8: Diabetes Is a Top 10 Cause of Death, Claiming 3–4 Million Lives per Year

Explanation: Diabetes isn’t only about chronic morbidity; it is also a major killer. Diabetes was responsible for an estimated 3.4 million deaths in 2024 – about one death every 9 seconds worldwide.



| Diabetes-Related Mortality | Statistic | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Annual deaths attributable to diabetes | 3.4 million (2024) – ~1 death every 9 seconds | IDF 11th Atlas (2025) |
| WHO-estimated direct diabetes deaths | 1.6 million (2021) | WHO Global Health Estimates |
| Deaths including diabetic kidney disease | 2.0+ million (2021) | WHO Fact Sheet 2024 |
| % of diabetes deaths under age 70 | 47% (global, 2021) | WHO Fact Sheet 2024 |
| Diabetes rank among causes of death | #8 worldwide in 2021 (top 10 cause) | WHO (Top 10 Causes report) |

### 📊 Figure 8

![Figure 8](figures/fig8_mortality.png)

> To regenerate this figure, run `python scripts/make_all_figures.py`.

### Takeaway for Health Professionals: For health professionals, these mortality figures are a wake-up call – diabetes isn’t just about managing blood sugar, it’s about preventing deaths on a large scale. Every time you help a patient control their diabetes or prevent one from developing it, you are potentially saving a life or extending it. This means aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors in diabetics (blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking cessation) is as important as glycemic control. It also means advocating at the policy level for diabetes prevention and care is literally a matter of life and death for millions.

## Insight #9: Diabetes Costs Over \$1 Trillion Per Year – A Heavy Economic Burden

Explanation: The diabetes epidemic carries an enormous economic cost. In 2024, global health expenditure on diabetes was estimated at USD \$1.015 trillion.




| Economic Impact | Value (USD) | Notes | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Global diabetes health expenditure (2024) | \$1.0 trillion | Highest ever; ~1.2% of global GDP, ~12% of health spending | IDF Atlas 2025 |
| Increase in spending since 2007 | +338% | \$232B (2007) → \$1,015B (2024) | IDF Atlas 2025 |
| Avg spending per person with diabetes | ~$1,700 per year (global) | Varies widely: >\$8,000 in North America vs <$150 in Africa | IDF 2021 / 2025 data |
| Africa’s share of global diabetes spend | ~1% | \$10 billion for 25 million patients | IDF Atlas 2025 (Africa) |
| U.S. share of global diabetes spend | ~\$400 billion (approx) | U.S. alone ≈ 40% of global spending (due to high costs) | IDF 10th Atlas (2021 est.) |

### 📊 Figure 9

![Figure 9](figures/fig9_economic.png)

> To regenerate this figure, run `python scripts/make_all_figures.py`.

### Takeaway for Health Professionals: For health professionals, the cost data highlights that diabetes isn’t just a clinical issue – it’s draining healthcare resources at an unprecedented scale. This underscores the importance of cost-effective management: prevention programs, patient education, and primary care management of diabetes can reduce expensive hospital admissions. Clinicians should also be mindful of prescribing cost-effective treatments and advocating for health insurance coverage for diabetes care. On a policy level, making the case for investment in diabetes prevention (like lifestyle intervention programs) can be backed by the argument that it will save money by averting costly complications down the line.

## Insight #10: One in Six Pregnancies Is Affected by High Blood Sugar (Gestational Diabetes on the Rise)

Explanation: Diabetes is not only a lifelong condition – it can also occur during pregnancy with serious implications. Globally, 1 in 5 live births (20%) is affected by hyperglycemia in pregnancy, which includes both pre-existing diabetes and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in the mother.



| Hyperglycemia in Pregnancy | Statistic | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prevalence of hyperglycemia in pregnancy (global) | 20% of pregnancies (1 in 5 live births) | IDF Atlas 2025 (HIP data) |
| Prevalence of gestational diabetes (GDM) only | ~17% of pregnancies (1 in 6) | IDF Atlas 2025 |
| Number of live births affected (2024) | ~23 million worldwide | IDF Atlas 2025 |
| Share of HIP cases in women under 30 | ~43.5% (nearly half of GDM cases are in women <30) | IDF Atlas 2025 |
| % of HIP cases in LMICs | >90% (vast majority in developing countries) | IDF 2019 / MNT 2022 data |

### 📊 Figure 10

![Figure 10](figures/fig10_hip.png)

> To regenerate this figure, run `python scripts/make_all_figures.py`.

### Takeaway for Health Professionals: For health professionals, this means integrating diabetes screening into antenatal care is critical – one in six pregnancies faces gestational diabetes, so obstetric and primary care providers must be vigilant. For health systems, it’s a reminder that NCD prevention starts early: managing GDM not only ensures safer pregnancies but also can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in both mother and child. Postpartum follow-up of women with GDM (to support lifestyle changes and regular diabetes screening) should be a standard practice to break the chain of risk across generations.


## Prevention & Health System Response: What Works Against the Diabetes Surge

With the data painting a sobering picture, what can be done to curb the diabetes epidemic? The good news is that we have evidence-based strategies at both the individual and population level to prevent type 2 diabetes and mitigate its impact:

### Lifestyle Modification is Highly Effective: Numerous studies have shown that preventive lifestyle interventions can sharply reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in high-risk individuals. Weight management is key – even a 5–7% reduction in body weight can cut progression to diabetes by ~50% in those with prediabetes, according to landmark trials. A healthy diet (rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, with limited sugars and refined carbs) and regular physical activity (at least 150 minutes/week) help maintain a healthy weight and improve insulin sensitivity. These measures are the cornerstone of diabetes prevention programs worldwide. For health professionals, counseling patients on diet and exercise, and supporting behavior change (perhaps via diabetes prevention programs or health coaching), is an important part of the response.

### Population-Level Interventions: Beyond individual counseling, public health policies are crucial. This can include campaigns to reduce sugar consumption (taxing sugar-sweetened beverages, improving food labeling), urban planning that encourages active living (parks, walkable cities), and school-based programs to instill healthy habits in youth. Some countries have seen stabilization in obesity trends through such multi-sectoral efforts, which in turn will aid diabetes control. Tobacco control is also relevant – smoking cessation reduces cardiovascular risk substantially in diabetics. In fact, WHO’s recommendations emphasize “whole population” approaches alongside targeted interventions.

### Early Detection & Primary Care: As highlighted earlier, a large chunk of diabetes goes undiagnosed. Strengthening primary health care so that routine screening (e.g., blood glucose or HbA1c tests for at-risk adults) becomes standard can catch diabetes early. Early detection should be coupled with prompt management. Primary care clinics need to be equipped to start patients on lifestyle advice, metformin, etc., and provide ongoing monitoring. Many countries are implementing “integrated NCD clinics” at the primary care level – where patients can get comprehensive risk-factor management (diabetes, hypertension, etc.) in one place. This integration improves efficiency and recognizes that diabetes often coexists with other conditions.

### Access to Essential Medicines and Care: A critical health system response is ensuring universal access to affordable diabetes care. Insulin, discovered over 100 years ago, is still out of reach for too many people in need. Governments and global health agencies (like through the WHO Global Diabetes Compact) are working to improve insulin availability and lower its cost. Training healthcare workers in diabetes management (especially in LMICs) is also key – including how to titrate insulin, manage complications, and educate patients. Innovative solutions like telemedicine can support diabetes care in remote or underserved areas, ensuring patients get advice between clinic visits.

### Education and Self-Management Support: Empowering people with diabetes to manage their condition is known to improve outcomes. Health professionals should facilitate diabetes self-management education: teaching patients about blood glucose monitoring, foot care, recognizing warning signs, and adhering to medications. Peer support groups and community health workers can reinforce these messages. Culturally tailored education is important to address myths and stigma around diabetes in different communities.

### Multi-disciplinary Care & Complication Prevention: Ideally, diabetes care should involve a team – doctors, nurses, dietitians, and when needed, specialists (eye doctors for retinal exams, podiatrists for foot care). Regular screening for complications (annual eye exams, kidney function tests, foot exams) helps detect problems early when they are more treatable. For example, checking and controlling blood pressure and cholesterol in a patient with diabetes is as critical as controlling blood sugar, to prevent heart attacks and strokes. Health systems should adopt protocols to ensure these checks happen routinely for diabetic patients.

Importantly, for health professionals at the frontline, adopting a patient-centered approach is vital. This means understanding the challenges patients face in adhering to lifestyle changes or medications (financial constraints, cultural dietary preferences, etc.), and working with them to find sustainable solutions.


## Conclusion & Call to Action

Diabetes has emerged from the shadows to become a defining challenge for global health in the 21st century. The data we’ve explored – from the doubling of cases in three decades to the billions spent and millions of lives lost – all point to a simple fact: diabetes can no longer be treated as a secondary issue.




### Comment & Engage: This World Diabetes Day and beyond, I invite you to reflect and act. How is diabetes impacting your community or practice? What successful strategies have you seen, and where are the gaps? Join the conversation – share your experiences or initiatives in the comments, and let’s learn from each other as we work to change the course of this silent epidemic. Together, we can ensure that in the coming years, the only thing “silent” about diabetes is how quietly we managed to stop its rise.
